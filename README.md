### This is windows cli folder root parser

Set parsing depth as an argument in call. Or use `"."` to parse all folder. Without arguments, it will parse a folder with a depth 1. 

### Example:
`"l 2"` -> will parse with depth 2

`"l"` -> will parse only files in the current folder

`"l ."` -> will parse all folder
